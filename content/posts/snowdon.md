## The Route


We climbed **Yr Wyddfa (Snowdon)** by way of the **Watkin Path**, a route less travelled, but no less dramatic. It begins in a green hush: mossy woodland, gurgling streams, and cascading falls. But soon, the path grows sharper, rockier, steeper.

> **Difficulty:** Moderate (elevated by rain)

## Hafod y Llan: Camp and Comfort


We made base at **Hafod y Llan**, tucked beneath the hills. A stream carved through the land beside us, birdsong in the trees above. It felt quiet. Ancient.


- **The night before:** We arrived under cloud, pitched in soft grass, and prepped our gear beneath the hiss of approaching rain.
 
- **The night after:** Soaked and satisfied, I stepped into what might’ve been the best shower of my life. Warmth returned. Then: a cocktail in hand, snacks in our laps, and rounds of **Uno** by lantern light, laughter echoing off damp tent.


- **The morning after:** A slow, welcome start. Coffee on the stove. Scrambled egg, cheese, and hot sauce wraps. With the tent packed down, we drove to **Conwy**, wandered the castle and town, grabbed lunch, and carried on home.

## The Climb: Into the Mist


The trail opens gently, trees, river, rock, and those unforgettable waterfalls. But by the time we hit 400m, the world had vanished into grey.


- **Visibility:** Just 3 metres near the top, the landscape swallowed by cloud.
- **Conditions:** Wet. Slippery. Constant wind. Paths turning to streams.
- **Scrambles:** One section, soaked in rain, felt like a V0/V1 bouldering problem , easy on paper, trickier in soaked boots.


We reached the summit eventually. No glamour. Just a touch to the trig point, a mouthful of **banana and peanut butter wrap**, and a quick retreat from the exposed, crowded peak.

## Final Reflections


Would I do it again? Without a doubt, but I’d pray for better weather. The Watkin Path is rewarding, and in clear skies, the views must be staggering.


> **Tip:** Skip weekends if you can. Even in storms, Snowdon’s summit draws queues.

### Would I recommend the Watkin Path?


Absolutely, but with care. It's not a casual stroll. it's one of the most evocative ways up the mountain.  

But in bad weather, come prepared.
