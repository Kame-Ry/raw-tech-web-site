Here's a ranked breakdown of my favorite games, scored across various categories that matter most to me — such as Narrative, Worldbuilding, Music, and Replayability.

---

## Scoring Criteria

- **Narrative**: Story strength and emotional weight
- **Worldbuilding**: Lore depth and cohesion
- **Music**: Soundtrack impact and memorability
- **Gameplay**: Mechanics, fluidity, and responsiveness
- **Replay**: Desire to revisit
- **Exploration**: Reward for curiosity
- **Progression**: Character or story growth
- **Art**: Visual style and design coherence

### Weighting System

> **How it's calculated**:  
> Each score is weighted based on personal importance (see above), then combined into a final score out of 100.

| Category      | Weight (%) |
|---------------|------------|
| Narrative     | 20         |
| Worldbuilding | 15         |
| Music         | 10         |
| Gameplay      | 15         |
| Replay        | 10         |
| Exploration   | 10         |
| Progression   | 10         |
| Art           | 10         |

Total score = weighted average across these categories, scaled to 100.
