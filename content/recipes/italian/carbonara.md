**Easy | Prep: 10 min | Cook: 15 min | Serves: 2**

## Ingredients

- 200g spaghetti  
- 100g pancetta (or Bacon)  
- 2 large eggs  
- 50g pecorino cheese, finely grated  
- 50g parmesan, finely grated  
- 2 garlic cloves, peeled and left whole  
- 50g unsalted butter  
- Freshly ground black pepper  
- Sea salt

## Method

1. **Prep the pasta**  
   Cook the spaghetti in a large pan of salted boiling water until al dente. (8 Minutes)

2. **Prepare the sauce**  
   Beat the eggs in a medium bowl, season with black pepper, and stir in the cheeses.

3. **Cook the pancetta**  
   Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan. Add the pancetta and garlic and fry until crisp. Discard garlic once golden.

4. **Combine**  
   Drain the pasta, reserving some cooking water. Add pasta to the pan with pancetta, remove from heat.

5. **Add egg mixture**  
   Quickly stir in the egg and cheese mixture. Toss vigorously, adding a little pasta water to create a silky sauce.

6. **Serve**  
   Top with extra cheese and freshly cracked pepper. Serve immediately.

## Notes

- Work fast with the egg mix to avoid scrambling.  
- Use guanciale instead of pancetta for a traditional version.  
- Don’t add cream, real carbonara doesn’t need it.
